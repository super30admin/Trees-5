while curr != null
    if curr's left is null
        then we dont have anything to explore in left
        print()
        now explore right
        curr = curr.right
    else
        We can explore left side too
        Get predecessor of curr node
        if(predecessor was already formed)
            that mean the left part was already explored
            so break the link and explore right
        else
            this means left was not explored, hence we need to form a link to come back to curr
            pre.right = curr
