## Problem1 Populating Next Right Pointers in Each Node(https://leetcode.com/problems/populating-next-right-pointers-in-each-node/)

You are given a perfect binary tree where all leaves are on the same level, and every parent has two children. The binary tree has the 
following definition:


Populate each next pointer to point to its next right node. If there is no next right node, the next pointer should be set to NULL.

Initially, all next pointers are set to NULL.

Example:



Input: {"$id":"1","left":{"$id":"2","left":{"$id":"3","left":null,"next":null,"right":null,"val":4},"next":null,"right":{"$id":"4","left":null,"next":null,"right":null,"val":5},"val":2},"next":null,"right":{"$id":"5","left":{"$id":"6","left":null,"next":null,"right":null,"val":6},"next":null,"right":{"$id":"7","left":null,"next":null,"right":null,"val":7},"val":3},"val":1}

Output: {"$id":"1","left":{"$id":"2","left":{"$id":"3","left":null,"next":{"$id":"4","left":null,"next":{"$id":"5","left":null,"next":{"$id":"6","left":null,"next":null,"right":null,"val":7},"right":null,"val":6},"right":null,"val":5},"right":null,"val":4},"next":{"$id":"7","left":{"$ref":"5"},"next":null,"right":{"$ref":"6"},"val":3},"right":{"$ref":"4"},"val":2},"next":null,"right":{"$ref":"7"},"val":1}

Explanation: Given the above perfect binary tree (Figure A), your function should populate each next pointer to point to its next right 
node, just like in Figure B.

Note:

You may only use constant extra space.

Recursive approach is fine, implicit stack space does not count as extra space for this problem.

## Problem2 Recover Binary Search Tree(https://leetcode.com/problems/recover-binary-search-tree/)

Two elements of a binary search tree (BST) are swapped by mistake.

Recover the tree without changing its structure.

Example 1:

Input: [1,3,null,null,2]


        1

      /

    3

      \

        2

Output: [3,1,null,null,2]


        3

      /

    1

      \

        2
Example 2:

Input: [3,1,4,null,null,2]


          3

        / \

      1   4

        /

      2

Output: [2,1,4,null,null,3]


        2

      / \

    1   4

       /

     3
